# gh-project-actions

**DEPRECATED**

Github has very similar Action in their Marketplace, built by Github. 

<https://github.com/marketplace/actions/add-to-github-projects>

Functionally only difference is you can not specify the target column.
However the project board can have a default column for new issues and PR's.
