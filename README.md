# gh-project-actions

**DEPRECATED**

GitHub has a very similar Action in their Marketplace, built by GitHub. 

<https://github.com/marketplace/actions/add-to-github-projects>

Functionally the only difference is you cannot specify the target column.
However the project board can have a default column for new issues and PRs.
